## Question 1
AIOPs standds for artificial intelligence for IT operations. It refers to multi-layered technology platforms that automate and enhance IT operations through analytics and machine learning (ML).\
AIOPs aims to automate managment diagnostics and finds the root cause to the data by machine learning. It provides IT teams with information that can be understood easily, reduces false positives, and minimizes noise\
MLOPs on the other hand focuses on automating the deployment on ML models to market\
It connects data science teams and infrastructure teams\
Unlike AIOPs MLOPs does not directly refer to machine learning. It aims to streamline the deployment and maintanence of machine learning algorithms.\
## Question 2
The main idea behind Interpretability is that we not only want to know what is being predicted but also why it is being predicted. This increases the accountability of our model.\
In Linear regression we predict the outcome as a sum of its weighted features. The interpretation of the weight of the model depends on type of the corresponding features.\
In case of a model regarding a house the features could be numerical(size of house), binary(checking if house has a garden), categorical(type of floor in the house)\
Linear regression forces our model to be linear. Linear systems are easy to understand. They are also additive.\
